# gomuks/push
This is a simple push gateway to let the [gomuks backend](https://github.com/tulir/gomuks)
send FCM push notifications to [gomuks android](https://github.com/gomuks/android).

The default instance is at push.gomuks.app, but it's probably possible to self-host by forking
the android app and using your own FCM credentials.
